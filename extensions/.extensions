# This is a file of your custom message classes, and their adapters(which are essentially handlers of your messages)
#
# usage:
#
# MessagePlatform will store your messages and adapters in a map so that when the BaseManager receives one of your custom messages
# it will know to run your custom adapter. Define your bindings as follows:
#
# MessageClassName : AdapterClassName,
# MessageClassName1 : AdapterClassName1
